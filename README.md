# daily_affirmations

This Flutter prototype demonstrates how to generate positive daily affirmations using OpenAI and includes a mock payment flow for potential monetization. It showcases:

• A Home Screen that uses the OpenAI API to fetch and display daily affirmations.  
• A Payment Screen with a mock payment process to illustrate how monetization could be integrated in the future.  
• Environment variable management with flutter_dotenv, providing an option to keep API keys and other sensitive data separate.
